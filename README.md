# boot-tools-deps

A Boot task that uses `tools.deps(.alpha)` to read in `deps.edn` files in the same way that the `clj` script uses them. Updates Boot's resources, sources, and classpath based on the paths, extra paths, and classpath computed by `tools.deps`. Can also update Boot's dependencies (for use by tasks like `uber`).

The primary use case for `boot-tools-deps` is that your project runs with `clj` -- so all of its dependencies are managed via `deps.edn` files, with aliases as appropriate -- and you want to bring Boot tooling to that project, in addition. If you have an existing Boot project, the assumption is that you move all of the code-level `:dependencies` into `deps.edn` and use aliases in preference to `:scope` in order to manage how dependencies are assembled -- leaving only Boot-level tooling in `:dependencies` or supply those dependencies via the command-line.

## Usage

You can either add this to your `build.boot` (or `profile.boot`) file's `:dependencies`:

    [seancorfield/boot-tools-deps "0.4.1"]

and then expose the task with:

    (require '[boot-tools-deps.core :refer [deps]])

or you can just add it as command line dependency:

    boot -d seancorfield/boot-tools-deps:0.4.1 deps ...

The available arguments that mirror `clj` and `tools.deps.alpha` are:

* `-c` `--config-files` -- specify the `deps.edn` files to be used
* `-r` `--repeatable` -- use only the local `deps.edn` file (or the `-c` specified files) -- note: the `-D` option is still read and used!
* `-D` `--config-data` -- provide an EDN string that is treated as an additional, final `deps.edn` file
* `-A` `--aliases` -- specify aliases of any kind (equivalent to specifying `-C`, `-M`, and `-R` all with the same alias)
* `-C` `--classpath-aliases` -- specify the aliases for classpath additions
* `-M` `--main-aliases` -- specify the aliases for main options
* `-R` `--resolve-aliases` -- specify the aliases for resolving dependencies

The available arguments that are specific to `boot-tools-deps` are:

* `-x` `--execute` -- after processing the `deps.edn` files, run `clojure.main/main` providing as arguments any _main-opts_ found by `tools.deps.alpha`
* `-B` `--overwrite-boot-deps` -- in addition to setting up the classpath (and `:resource-paths` and `source-paths`), overwrite Boot's `:dependencies` with those returned from `tools.deps` -- note: this is only required for Boot tasks such as `uber` to function correctly!
* `-Q` `--quick-merge` -- in addition to setting up the classpath etc, perform a quick and simple merge into Boot's `:dependencies` of those returned from `tools.deps` -- note: this is sometimes required for certain Boot tooling to work later on in the pipeline; it cannot be used with `-B` and should not be used with `uber` since it will include all your tooling dependencies as well
* `-v` `--verbose` -- explain what the task is doing (`-vv` also makes `tools.deps` verbose)

### Specifying aliases for tasks in `build.boot`

You can specify different classpaths for different tasks. For example, to use the default classpath for the `build` task:

    (deftask build
      "Build and install the project locally."
      []
      (comp (deps) (pom :project 'foo/bar :version "0.1.0" ) (jar :main 'clojure.main) (install)))

And to add the `:test` alias when testing:

    (require '[adzerk.boot-test :as boot-test])

    (deftask test
      "Runs tests"
      []
      (comp (deps :aliases [:test])
            (boot-test/test)))

## Differences from how `clj` works

* The "system" `deps.edn` file is not read but `boot-tools-deps` merges in a copy taken from the `clojure/brew-install` repository so the effect should be the same. _This means the default `deps.edn` information may lag behind the latest, distributed/installed version, or may be ahead of the version you actually have installed (if you have not updated `clojure` recently). The version of Clojure used is whatever version is running by the time this task is run -- you can only change that via `BOOT_CLOJURE_VERSION` or `~/.boot/boot.properties`, not via `deps.edn`._
* `clj` computes the full classpath and caches it in a local file. _`boot-tools-deps` computes the classpath on every invocation._
* Whatever value of `:paths` comes back from `tools.deps` is used as the `:resource-paths` value for Boot.
* Whatever value of `:extra-paths` comes back from `tools.deps` is used as the base `:source-paths` value for Boot. You can use Boot's `sift` task to treat them as resources instead.
* Any additional folders found on the computed classpath produced by `tools.deps` are added to the `:source-paths` and any JAR files on the computed classpath are added directly to Boot's in-memory classpath. _Boot's `:dependencies` are not updated by default._
* `clojure.main` is only executed if you specify the `-x` option (`clj` always runs this).
* In order to run tasks that depend on Boot's `:dependencies`, such as `uber`, you need to specify either the `-B` option to overwrite Boot's `:dependencies` with the computed dependencies produced by `tools.deps` or the `-Q` option to merge the computed dependencies into Boot's `:dependencies`. _Note: transitive dependencies do not inherit the `:scope` of the dependency that caused them to be included!_

## Changes

* 0.4.2 -- (in progress) -- Add `:classifier` to modifiers that `boot-tools-deps` passes back from `tools.deps.alpha` (in addition to `:exclusions` and `:scope` -- @superstructor).
* 0.4.1 -- 02/02/2018 -- Fix `-D` option (broken in 0.4.0).
* 0.4.0 -- 02/02/2018 -- Destroy pod inline instead of in a future; update to `tools.deps.alpha` 0.5.351; add support for `-M` (main-aliases) and `-x` to execute `clojure.main`.
* 0.3.0 -- 02/02/2018 -- Add `-Q` (quick merge) for Boot's `:dependencies` to better support certain tool chains (#15); refactor `tools-deps` to match arguments for `load-deps` for easier reuse as a library (#11); update docstrings (to match current usage and explain it better); updated README to better clarify intended usage (#12).
* 0.2.3 -- 01/31/2018 -- Ensure pod environment gets recent version of Clojure (@superstructor).
* 0.2.2 -- 01/29/2018 -- Refactor pod code to a separate namespace to make the code easier to work with (@superstructor).
* 0.2.1 -- 01/29/2018 -- Make Clojure a `:provided` dependency for consistency (@superstructor).
* 0.2.0 -- 01/28/2018 -- Update to use the most recent `tools.deps.alpha` release; directly update the Boot classpath (which means Git and Local dependencies are now supported!); run `tools.deps` inside a Boot pod; no longer update Boot's `:dependencies` by default.
* 0.1.4 -- 12/06/2017 -- Fix #3 by updating `deps.edn` template from `brew-install` (changes Clojars repo URL); fix #4 by correcting how `-r` and `-c` options affect the list of `deps.edn` files used; switches from `HOME` environment variable to `user.home` system property; adds `-A` option for when you need the same alias on both `-R` and `-C`; now relies on `tools.deps.alpha.makecp` loading all the specific providers (instead of loading them manually).
* 0.1.3 -- 11/15/2017 -- Fix #2 by using `deps.edn` template from `brew-install` repo as defaults.
* 0.1.2 -- 11/13/2017 -- Expose `deps` task machinery as a function, `load-deps`, for more flexibility.
* 0.1.1 -- 11/12/2017 -- First working version.
